# Render Deployment Instructions

## 1. Prerequisites
- You need a MongoDB database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- You need a Cloudinary account for file uploads
- You need JWT secret and settings

## 2. Environment Variables (set in Render dashboard)
- `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME`: Your MongoDB database name
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: Your Cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: Your Cloudinary API key
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Your Cloudinary API secret
- `JWT_SECRET`: Your JWT secret
- `JWT_ISSUER`: Your JWT issuer (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)
- `JWT_AUDIENCE`: Your JWT audience (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com`)

## 3. Docker Build & Start Commands (set in Render dashboard)
- **Build Command:**
  ```
  docker build -t webapi .
  ```
- **Start Command:**
  ```
  docker run -p 10000:80 webapi
